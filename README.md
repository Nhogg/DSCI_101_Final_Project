# Overview
I completed this project as part of my Introduction to Data Science Class at Loyola Chicago. I used a dataset titled "Fraudulent E-Commerce Transactions" from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shriyashjagtap/fraudulent-e-commerce-transactions).
The output can be found [here]{https://nhogg.github.io/DSCI_101_Final_Project/}

> The "index.html" file houses the typical <project>.html file for this project. I had to rename it to index to host it on Github Pages.
# Project Proposal
I will be investigating factors that contribute to fraudulent transactions, such as user age, payment method, product type, and account age. I will likely strip some of the variables that are unnecessary, such as location, device used, and ip address as they donâ€™t have much bearing on the analysis.
# Questions of Interest
What factors lead to fraudulent transactions? Are younger people more likely to be scammed than older people? Is there a certain type of item that is frequently fraudulently sold? Are certain payment methods more fraud-resistant? Does price matter, or are larger purchases scams as frequently as smaller ones?
# Project Report
The project report can be found in this repository, as well as on my Linkedin.
